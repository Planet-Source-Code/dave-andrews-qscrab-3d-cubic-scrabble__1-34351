### Description

***UPDATED WITH USER REQUESTS***

A one-player 3D scrabble™ game using DirectX7. Has a 250,000 word dictionary (plain text). Will check and verify the words. Uses standard scrabble™ rules and scoring - except you can build words around corners. It is lots of fun. To Play, simply click on a letter in the 'rack' and then rotate the cube and click the space you want to place the letter.

I might end up modifying the game to be 2-player over the TCP/IP if enough interest and positive feedback is given.

If you think it's worthy of a vote, then vote. I would appreciate any user feedback and suggestions to improve this game.

Enjoy!
